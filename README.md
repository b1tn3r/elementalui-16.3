# Elemental UI for React 16.3

React & CSS UI Framework that has been updated to work with the latest version of React (v16 and up)

The original elemental-ui is located at [elementalui/elemental](https://github.com/elementalui/elemental) and was built by [@JedWatson](https://github.com/JedWatson) and [@JossMac](https://github.com/JossMac) at [Thinkmill](http://www.thinkmill.com.au).

See [elemental-ui.com](http://elemental-ui.com) for examples and documentation.

## Browser Support

We'd like Elemental to be viable (functionally and aesthetically) to as many browsers as possible, without hindering our ability to move quickly.

For now that means:

- Chrome (mobile and desktop)
- Safari (mobile and desktop)
- Firefox
- Internet Explorer 10 and up
